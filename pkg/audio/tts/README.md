# TTS (Text-to-Speech)

This package handles speech synthesis for MintClaw.

If you are new to TTS setup, the simplest workflow is:

1. Add an enabled TTS-capable entry to `model_list` with explicit `provider` and `model` fields.
2. Point `voice.tts_model_name` at that entry.
3. Put the API key in `.security.yml`.

## Quick Recommendation

For most users, these are the best starting points:

| Provider | Why start here |
| --- | --- |
| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech) | Best-supported path in MintClaw today. The current TTS implementation is built around the OpenAI-compatible `/audio/speech` API shape, and OpenAI is the safest default. |
| [Xiaomi MiMo](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com) | A good second option if you want an OpenAI-compatible provider endpoint and are already using MiMo models in the rest of your stack. |

## How TTS Configuration Works

MintClaw does not keep TTS API keys inside `voice`.

Instead:

- `voice.tts_model_name` selects a named entry from `model_list`.
- That `model_list` entry provides the provider, model ID, API base, and proxy settings.
- For providers that need model-specific TTS parameters, use `model_list[].extra_body`
  to pass fields such as `voice` and `response_format`.
- `.security.yml` stores the API key for the same named model entry.

This is the recommended and supported configuration pattern.

## Recommended Setup

### Option A: OpenAI

`config.json`

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "tts_model_name": "openai-tts"
  },
  "model_list": [
    {
      "model_name": "openai-tts",
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "tts-1",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`.security.yml`

```yaml
model_list:
  openai-tts:
    api_keys:
      - "sk-openai-your-key"
```

### Option B: Xiaomi MiMo

`config.json`

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "tts_model_name": "mimo-tts"
  },
  "model_list": [
    {
      "model_name": "mimo-tts",
      "provider": "mimo",
      "model": "mimo-v2-tts",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`.security.yml`

```yaml
model_list:
  mimo-tts:
    api_keys:
      - "your-mimo-key"
```

If you use a custom MiMo endpoint, you can also set `api_base` explicitly. Otherwise MintClaw will use the provider default.

### Option C: OpenRouter MAI Voice 2

Some OpenAI-compatible TTS routes require provider-specific request fields.
OpenRouter's `microsoft/mai-voice-2` is one example: it needs a model-specific
voice name and works best with `response_format: "mp3"`.

`config.json`

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "tts_model_name": "mai-voice-2"
  },
  "model_list": [
    {
      "model_name": "mai-voice-2",
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "model": "microsoft/mai-voice-2",
      "enabled": true,
      "api_base": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
      "extra_body": {
        "voice": "en-US-Harper:MAI-Voice-2",
        "response_format": "mp3"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`.security.yml`

```yaml
model_list:
  mai-voice-2:
    api_keys:
      - "sk-or-your-openrouter-key"
```

## What MintClaw Sends Today

The current TTS runtime uses an OpenAI-compatible speech request with these defaults:

- Endpoint: `/audio/speech`
- Response format: `opus`
- Voice: `alloy`
- Model: taken from the selected `model_list` entry

These defaults can now be overridden per model through `model_list[].extra_body`.

That means:

- `provider: openai` with `model: tts-1` works naturally.
- Other OpenAI-compatible providers can work if they accept the same request format.
- Provider-specific TTS models may need their own `voice` and `response_format` values.
- If a provider rejects `response_format`, MintClaw retries once without that field.

## How MintClaw Chooses a TTS Provider

`DetectTTS` resolves TTS through one explicit path:

1. Resolve `voice.tts_model_name` against enabled entries in `model_list`.
2. If a matching entry exists and has an API key, MintClaw creates the TTS provider using that entry's settings.
3. If the selection is missing, disabled, invalid, or lacks an API key, TTS remains disabled.

## Notes About API Base Handling

MintClaw normalizes the configured base URL for TTS:

- For OpenAI, a base like `https://api.openai.com` or `https://api.openai.com/v1` becomes `https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech`.
- For other OpenAI-compatible providers, MintClaw preserves the configured base path and ensures it ends with `/audio/speech`.
- If `api_base` is omitted, MintClaw uses the configured provider's default base when available.

## Common Mistakes

- Setting `voice.tts_model_name` to a name that does not exist in `model_list`.
- Adding a TTS model but forgetting to put its API key in `.security.yml`.
- Assuming MintClaw will automatically infer provider-specific custom voices.
- Forgetting to set `model_list[].extra_body.voice` or `model_list[].extra_body.response_format` for TTS models that require them.
- Using a provider endpoint that is not compatible with the OpenAI `/audio/speech` request format.

## Minimal Checklist

Before testing `send_tts`, make sure:

- `voice.tts_model_name` matches a `model_list[].model_name`.
- The selected model entry has explicit `provider` and `model` fields and `enabled: true`.
- The matching `.security.yml` entry contains a valid API key.
- The chosen provider supports an OpenAI-compatible speech synthesis endpoint.
- Your selected model is actually a TTS-capable model.
