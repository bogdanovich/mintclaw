# AgentLoop Runtime Host

`pkg/agent.AgentLoop` is the runtime host for an agent workspace. It owns shared
services and public APIs, but it should not contain turn-step execution logic.
One logical agent turn still starts at `runAgentLoop`; detailed turn execution is
delegated to `Pipeline`.

## Responsibility Split

| Layer | Owns | Should Not Own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AgentLoop` | process lifecycle, service wiring, registry/config access, public APIs, active-turn registry, channel/bus integration | turn lifecycle or LLM/tool iteration mechanics |
| `inboundTurnCoordinator` | inbound scheduling, same-session serialization, busy-session steering enqueue, worker goroutine lifecycle, ack/release decisions | route normalization or LLM/tool execution |
| `runtimeSessionClaim` | atomic session placeholder claim/release semantics shared by inbound workers and recovery | turn execution, routing, delivery |
| `inboundMessageTurn` | normalized inbound route/session/model/dispatch envelope for one message | command handling or pipeline execution |
| `turnRunner` | one runtime generation's turn lifecycle, config snapshot, and pipeline wiring | process reload policy or LLM/tool iteration mechanics |
| `Pipeline` | context assembly, LLM calls, tool loops, steering injection during a turn, finalization | inbound bus scheduling or session claiming |

## Inbound Flow

1. `AgentLoop.Run` initializes runtime services and reads inbound/observed bus
   channels.
2. Inbound messages are delegated to `inboundTurnCoordinator`.
3. The coordinator resolves the message's steering target. Non-routable/system
   messages stay synchronous.
4. For routable messages, the coordinator claims the session through
   `runtimeSessionClaim`.
5. If the session is already active, the message becomes queued steering for
   that session, except `/stop`, which is handled immediately.
6. If the claim succeeds, a worker goroutine acquires the worker semaphore,
   handles pending stop state, runs `runTurnWithSteering`, and then acks or
   releases the inbound spool entry.
7. `runTurnWithSteering` calls `processMessage`, then drains queued steering
   continuations for the same session before publishing the final response.

This keeps same-session messages serialized while allowing different sessions
to run concurrently up to the configured worker limit.

## Turn Launch Boundary

`processMessage` is the last host-side step before turn execution. It prepares
and logs the inbound message, handles system messages, builds an
`inboundMessageTurn`, processes commands, applies pending skill overrides, and
then calls:

```go
al.runAgentLoop(ctx, turn.Agent, opts)
```

`runAgentLoop` remains the boundary for one logical agent turn. `AgentLoop`
selects the current `turnRunner`; that runner wraps the turn with lifecycle
concerns and delegates turn progression to:

```go
pipeline.runTurnLoop(ctx, turnCtx, ts)
```

Code below that boundary should be considered turn execution and belongs in
`Pipeline` or pipeline-owned helpers.

`AgentLoop` constructs one runner and pipeline snapshot during initialization,
then atomically replaces the runner when config or injected runtime wiring
changes. Admitted turns retain their original runner; new turns use the new
generation. This avoids rebuilding dependency bags for every user and child
turn without allowing a reload to mutate an in-flight pipeline.

In-turn events, aborts, steering polls, sensitive-data filtering, and final
render policy use that pipeline snapshot directly. `turnRunner` calls
`AgentLoop` only for the process lifecycle it actually owns: turn admission,
active-turn registration, context publication for tools, and inbound spool
settlement. There is no single-implementation callback interface between the
runner and pipeline.

Config-derived turn behavior reads that runner-owned `Cfg` snapshot directly.
It does not pass through policy interfaces for model selection, retries,
streaming, media limits, prompt construction, or tool-content filtering. Keep a
seam only when the runtime has a real alternate implementation, such as the
deterministic retry sleeper used by timing tests.

Pipeline runtime wiring is also direct. Bus and event emission retain narrow
interfaces because tests and alternate buses provide real implementations.
Active-request counting and turn abort use their concrete owners; they do not
sit behind a service bag or single-implementation interface.

Pipeline context wiring keeps its semantic grouping, but not artificial
interfaces. Context assembly, steering, and media resolution retain narrow
interfaces because they have real substitutes. Background compaction, model
execution, and terminal-task context use their concrete generation owners so
the immutable pipeline snapshot remains explicit across reloads.

## Session Claiming

`runtimeSessionClaim` is the shared session ownership primitive. A claim stores
a setup placeholder in `AgentLoop.activeTurnStates` with `LoadOrStore`, so two
messages for the same session cannot both launch workers during setup.

Claims release only the exact placeholder they installed. This is intentional:
if a real `turnState` or a newer placeholder replaces the original value, stale
cleanup must not delete it.

Current claim users:

- inbound workers, including context-cancel cleanup while waiting for the worker
  semaphore
- pending-stop cleanup before draining queued steering
- unanswered-session recovery

## Recovery

Unanswered-session recovery scans durable session history for sessions ending in
an unanswered user message. When recovery launches a turn, it now claims the
session through the same `runtimeSessionClaim` primitive used by inbound
workers.

Recovery still builds its own `processOptions` because the unanswered user
message is already durable history and must not be appended again as a fresh
user message.

## Intentional Coupling

Some coupling remains by design:

- `AgentLoop` still owns `activeTurnStates` because `/stop`, `/subagents`,
  hard abort, recovery, and runtime observability all need the same live turn
  registry.
- `processMessage` still handles commands before `runAgentLoop` because commands
  need routed session/model context but should not always start an LLM turn.
- `runTurnWithSteering` still publishes the final joined response after
  continuation drains. This preserves current delivery behavior while keeping
  in-turn steering injection inside `Pipeline`.
- `inboundMessageTurn` still lives in `pkg/agent` rather than a new package
  because it depends on agent registry, routing, session allocation, and model
  binding internals. Moving it would create an artificial package boundary.

Future refactors should preserve this rule: host/runtime code may decide when a
turn starts and how it is observed or delivered, but the turn's internal LLM and
tool progression belongs to `Pipeline`.
