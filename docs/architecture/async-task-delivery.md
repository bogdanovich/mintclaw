# Async Task Delivery

MintClaw background work now uses an explicit task/completion/delivery shape:

1. A tool or child runtime records a durable task in the task registry.
2. When the async result completes, the runtime builds a typed `AsyncCompletionInput`.
3. The delivery coordinator applies the requested delivery mode: `user_only`, `parent_only`, or `user_and_parent`.
4. User delivery goes through normal outbound text/media delivery.
5. Parent synthesis calls `processAsyncCompletion` directly. It must not publish a synthetic `system` inbound message.
6. The task registry records delivery status, completion id, delivery timestamp, and delivery error if one occurs.

## Current Ownership Boundaries

The runtime now has three distinct delivery paths, and each has a clear owner:

1. Sync tool delivery during the turn
   - Owner: the sync tool loop in `pipeline_execute.go`
   - Scope: normal tool execution and hook-respond tool results
   - Source of truth:
     - `ToolResult.Delivery.Intent`
     - explicit delivery outcome (`none`, `direct`, `queued`)
   - Current invariant:
     - `direct` delivery may terminate the turn as fully handled
     - queued media/text may still require a follow-up LLM turn depending on the tool path

2. Final-turn delivery after the loop
   - Owner: `agent_outbound.go`
   - Scope: final answer text and final completion media after the turn result is known
   - Source of truth:
     - final `turnResult`
     - same delivery helpers used for media/text dispatch
   - Current invariant:
     - final media prefers the normal tool-style delivery path
     - if media delivery does not land, the runtime falls back to final text

3. Async completion delivery after child/background work
   - Owner: `delivery_coordinator.go`
   - Scope: spawn/delegate/async tool completions
   - Source of truth:
     - `AsyncCompletionInput`
     - registry delivery status
     - delivery mode: `user_only`, `parent_only`, `user_and_parent`
   - Current invariant:
     - duplicate user/media/parent delivery is suppressed durably
     - parent synthesis never re-enters through synthetic `system` inbound messages

This is not yet a single fully unified delivery coordinator for every runtime
path. The current state is intentionally incremental:

- async completion policy is centrally coordinated
- sync tool and final-turn delivery now share more helper logic and explicit
  delivery outcomes
- remaining parallel policy branches are removed in focused changes

## Deliverables

`ToolResult` keeps produced output separate from runtime directives:

- `ForLLM`: context for the model.
- `ForUser`: text that may be sent directly to the user.
- `Deliverable`: the actual produced result/artifacts.
- `Control`: async and human-suspension ownership; never produced output.
- `Delivery`: the one delivery intent, async routing mode, and prepared
  outbound transaction.

Delivery intent is a single enum. `final_handled`, `immediate_continue`, and
`silent` cannot coexist as independent flags. Changing control or delivery
does not rewrite `ForLLM`, `ForUser`, or `Deliverable`.

`taskresult.Deliverable` is the ownership payload for durable task state. It
describes what was produced through canonical text, artifacts, metadata,
objective outcome, and an optional versioned report. It must not depend on the
wording of the final chat response.

Tools, child turns, delegated tasks, interactions, task records, and status
views carry this exact type. They do not reconstruct task state from prose or
translate through a second completion payload.

Current contract summary:

- `deliverable`
  - durable ownership payload
  - source of truth for produced text/artifacts in registry/status/board views
- final chat wording
  - a projection for users
  - must not be parsed by runtimes as task state

## Typed Task Events

The task registry has two layers:

- `Record`: the current-state projection for status tools, board views, and
  integrations.
- `TaskEvent`: the append-only canonical event stream for lifecycle and
  delivery transitions.

This follows the same principle as durable deliverables: structured state is
canonical; chat, terminal text, and UI strings are projections. Producers should
not require another agent to parse prose in order to decide whether a task
started, completed, failed, delivered, or needs recovery.

`TaskEvent` currently records:

- schema version
- task, board, parent, and step identity
- runtime and producer
- event type
- task status and delivery status
- per-task sequence number
- emitted timestamp
- fingerprint
- small structured payload

The initial event types are:

- `task.upserted`
- `task.status_changed`
- `task.delivery_changed`
- `task.delivery_decision`
- `task.progress`
- `task.updated`
- `task.reconciled`

`task.delivery_decision` is emitted by the async delivery coordinator before it
attempts user delivery or parent synthesis. It records the completion id,
source tool, delivery mode, whether user and/or parent delivery will run, and
the result size hints. The later `task.delivery_changed` event records the
durable delivery outcome. Keeping both events makes failed deliveries and
restart recovery auditable without parsing chat text.

Cron-triggered tasks also emit `task.delivery_decision` when the runtime starts
the cron execution. The cron task record's `delivery_mode` distinguishes the
execution shape:

- `deliver_text`: publish the scheduled text directly without an agent turn.
- `agent_turn`: run the scheduled message through the agent.
- `command`: execute the scheduled command path.

This makes reminders auditable from task status alone: an operator can see why
the cron run fired, whether it was direct text or an agent turn, and the later
delivery outcome without reading service logs or inferring behavior from chat
wording.

The event stream is persisted in the same `state/task_registry.json` snapshot
as `tasks`. `Record` remains the current projection API and is still what most
tools read. Consumers that care about auditability, idempotency, or recovery
should prefer events and treat records as a projection.

### Retention and Snapshot Bounds

The registry compacts deterministically: expired terminal records with final
delivery states are removed first; record-count retention removes the oldest
remaining eligible terminal records; event-count retention removes the oldest
events; and byte retention removes the smallest necessary oldest event prefix
before removing the oldest eligible terminal records. This keeps current task
projections and active delivery state durable while bounding routine growth.

Records are eligible only after they are terminal and their delivery state is
final. Running, queued, non-terminal, and pending-delivery tasks are protected
even if that leaves the serialized snapshot over its configured byte limit.
The runtime logs that exceptional state on registry load rather than discarding
recoverable work.

Current source-of-truth rule:

- audit/debug/recovery
  - prefer `TaskEvent`
- task status, board views, and tool/UI projections
  - prefer normalized `Record`
- user-facing prose
  - never treat chat text as canonical lifecycle state

Migration TODO:

- Emit explicit delivery events for additional coordinator/reconciliation
  phases when a consumer needs finer-grained observability.
- Introduce a versioned `DeliverableReport` shape for rich outputs with claims,
  artifacts, field deltas, and provenance.
- Render Telegram/GitHub/web summaries from structured reports instead of
  freeform child-agent prose.

## Status Tools

Use `task_status` for durable task history across spawn, delegate, cron executions, and future background runtimes. It is the source of truth for completed tasks and restart-persistent state.

Use `task_status {"task_id":"...","include_events":true}` to inspect a task's
full typed event stream. The output includes the current record projection,
completion id, delivery timestamp/error, and event lines with runtime, producer,
source, status, delivery status, payload kind, delivery mode, completion id,
fingerprint, and payload. Use `task_status {"include_events":true}` without a
specific `task_id` to show recent events for each visible task in the list.

Active delegate/spawn runs periodically heartbeat the task registry by updating
`last_event_at` while their child turn is still running. `freshness=stalled`
therefore means the active run has not reported liveness recently, not merely
that it started a long time ago.

`task_status` is the sole runtime status tool. It reads the canonical registry
for spawn, delegate, cron, and other task runtimes; no spawn-only projection is
maintained.

## Legacy System Messages

Older async completion paths used synthetic inbound messages with `channel=system` and `kind=async_completion`. That path is now an adapter only, so queued or stored legacy messages can still be processed.

New producers must not enqueue async completions through `PublishInbound(system)`. They should use `AsyncCompletionInput` and the delivery coordinator instead.

Current legacy boundary:

- reading legacy synthetic async completion messages is still supported
- producing new synthetic async completion messages is not allowed
- extending legacy `completion` payloads with new semantics is not allowed

## Runtime Smoke Checklist

- Run a simple media task that only sends a video.
- Run a composite media task that sends a video and returns text for parent synthesis.
- Run or trigger a scheduled cron task and confirm it appears as `runtime=cron`.
- Check `task_status` after completion.
- Restart the service.
- Check `task_status` again and confirm completed tasks are still visible.
- Confirm no completed task replays user-visible text or media after restart.
