# Durable Human Interaction

## Status

Implemented on MintClaw `main`. The architecture landed through PRs #263,
#264, #266, #268, #269, and #270. This document describes the contracts the
runtime preserves; operator-facing usage and configuration are documented in
[Durable Human Interaction](../guides/human-interaction.md).

## Problem

MintClaw can suspend a foreground turn or durable background task, release
runtime resources, survive a restart, and later resume the exact tool call after
an authorized person responds. Trusted approval hooks can use the same durable
interaction state machine, and background tasks expose `waiting_for_input`.

This prevents agents from safely handling workflows such as:

- asking the user to choose between materially different implementations;
- collecting missing deployment parameters without abandoning a task;
- pausing a background coding task for a product decision;
- requiring human approval before a sensitive shell or network operation;
- surviving a process restart while any of those questions are outstanding.

The feature must not keep an agent goroutine, provider request, session claim,
or tool execution open while it waits. Waiting may last hours and is durable
workflow state, not an active model turn.

## Design Goals

1. Provide a built-in `request_user_input` tool with structured questions.
2. Use one durable interaction subsystem for model questions and approvals.
3. Resume the original tool call with a correctly paired tool result.
4. Correlate answers to the canonical session, route, sender, and request.
5. Make answer acceptance and restart recovery idempotent.
6. Represent waiting background tasks honestly as `waiting_for_input`.
7. Expose typed lifecycle events and optional, non-authoritative debugging
   evidence.
8. Keep policy authority outside model-controlled tool arguments.
9. Work across text channels without requiring channel-specific forms.

## Non-Goals

- Holding an LLM or tool request open while a person responds.
- Treating arbitrary steering messages as answers.
- Building a general workflow engine or distributed transaction system.
- Granting durable policy exceptions based on model-generated text.
- Supporting multiple simultaneous unresolved interactions in one canonical
  session in the first version.
- Automatically choosing an answer when a request times out.

## Prior Art and Deliberate Differences

OpenClaw's ask-user tool provides a useful structured question schema, explicit
timeouts, and a gateway boundary. Its current pending-question map is in process
memory and restricts blocking questions to the main session. MintClaw adopts
the structured UX and bounded inputs, but replaces the in-memory wait with a
durable suspend/resume protocol that also works for background tasks.

Hermes cleanly separates clarification and approval callbacks from ordinary
tool execution. Its approval queues are also process-local. MintClaw adopts
the separation between clarification and authorization, while storing both as
typed interactions with restart reconciliation.

MintClaw already has stronger primitives that this design reuses: canonical
routed session keys, sender and topic context, durable task records, completion
IDs, and runtime events. Interaction state augments those subsystems instead of
creating a second routing or task model.

## Core Model

An interaction is a durable request for one authorized human response.

```go
type InteractionKind string

const (
    InteractionQuestion InteractionKind = "question"
    InteractionApproval InteractionKind = "approval"
)

type InteractionStatus string

const (
    InteractionCreated   InteractionStatus = "created"
    InteractionWaiting   InteractionStatus = "waiting"
    InteractionClaimed   InteractionStatus = "answer_claimed"
    InteractionResuming  InteractionStatus = "resuming"
    InteractionCanceling InteractionStatus = "canceling"
    InteractionResolved  InteractionStatus = "resolved"
    InteractionCancelled InteractionStatus = "cancelled"
    InteractionFailed    InteractionStatus = "failed"
)

type InteractionOutcome string

const (
    OutcomeAnswered InteractionOutcome = "answered"
    OutcomeTimedOut InteractionOutcome = "timed_out"
    OutcomeAllowed  InteractionOutcome = "allowed"
    OutcomeDenied   InteractionOutcome = "denied"
    OutcomeDeliveryUnknown InteractionOutcome = "delivery_unknown"
)
```

Each record contains:

- a random opaque interaction ID and short display ID;
- kind, status, terminal outcome, creation/update/expiry timestamps, and state
  revision;
- agent, canonical session, route session, channel, chat, topic, and account;
- authorized sender identity captured from trusted inbound context;
- originating turn ID, tool call ID, and tool name;
- optional durable task ID;
- bounded structured questions or a policy-generated approval prompt;
- delivery state and attempt metadata;
- the accepted answer, answer message identity, and sanitized display form;
- resume attempt metadata and terminal error details.

The raw arguments of a tool awaiting approval are not copied into this record.
Approval records contain a policy-produced bounded summary and a keyed hash of
canonical arguments. Full arguments remain in canonical session history and,
when enabled, protected full traces under their existing retention policy.

## State Machine

```text
created -> waiting -> answer_claimed -> resuming -> resolved
    |         |              |             |
    |         |              |             +-> failed
    |         |              +-> retry recovery (status unchanged)
    |         +-> answer_claimed (timeout outcome)
    +-> canceling -> cancelled
    +-> failed
```

Rules:

- Transitions use compare-and-swap semantics on ID, status, and revision.
- Only `waiting` accepts an answer.
- Only one nonterminal interaction may exist per canonical session.
- Explicit concurrent `/answer <short-id> ...` commands are first-writer-wins.
  The registry's atomic answer claim chooses the durable winner.
- An exact transport replay with the accepted inbound message identity is an
  idempotent no-op.
- A different explicit answer after `answer_claimed` may receive an explanatory
  response, cannot overwrite the first answer, and is never reclassified as
  steering or follow-up input.
- A recoverable commit or resume failure records an attempt without reopening
  the request; the accepted answer remains immutable while recovery retries.
- Terminal records are retained for a bounded audit period, then pruned.
- Lifecycle status and resolution outcome are separate. Timeout never silently
  selects an option or becomes terminal before resumption: it atomically claims
  the request with `OutcomeTimedOut`, appends an explicit timeout tool result,
  and resumes the model so it can explain or choose another safe path.

## Durable Storage

Use a dedicated interaction store under the configured data directory, following
the task registry's atomic append/checkpoint and bounded event-log patterns.
Do not place interaction records in general configuration or session metadata.

Required store operations are intentionally narrow:

```go
type InteractionStore interface {
    Create(context.Context, CreateInteraction) (Interaction, error)
    Get(context.Context, string) (Interaction, error)
    FindWaiting(context.Context, AnswerRoute) ([]Interaction, error)
    Transition(context.Context, TransitionInteraction) (Interaction, error)
    ListNonterminal(context.Context) ([]Interaction, error)
    Prune(context.Context, time.Time) error
}
```

The first implementation may use a JSON checkpoint plus append-only event log,
provided writes are atomic, revisions are monotonic, corruption fails closed,
and retention is bounded. An interface keeps a future database backend possible
without leaking persistence details into tools or channel adapters.

## Suspension Contract

The pipeline needs an explicit suspended outcome. Suspension is neither success,
failure, abort, nor finalization.

```go
const ToolControlSuspend ToolControl = ...

type turnResult struct {
    // existing fields
    suspendedInteractionID string
}
```

When `request_user_input` or approval suspends execution:

1. The assistant tool-call message is already durably persisted by the LLM
   phase. Creation of the interaction verifies that persistence succeeded.
2. The interaction is persisted before its outbound prompt is published.
3. The interaction binds a deterministic prompt outbox ID before publication.
   The prompt then follows the ordinary durable message-bus path. The outbox is
   the sole owner of `pending`, `attempting`, `delivered`, definitely-not-sent,
   `abandoned`, ambiguous, and retry-exhausted transport state. A receipt is
   scoped to its admission, so a retry cannot observe the preceding attempt's
   failure as its own result. Only a confirmed delivery moves the interaction
   to `waiting`. A future retry deadline is honored, and both live publication
   and recovery revalidate that the interaction is still active immediately
   before publishing. Gateway-owned retries settle their exact receipt without
   waiting for the periodic interaction scan. Ambiguous outcomes are never
   resent automatically because most channel APIs do not provide an
   idempotency key.
4. The tool loop returns `ToolControlSuspend` without adding a fabricated tool
   result for the suspended call.
5. Remaining tool calls in the same model response are recorded as deferred and
   are not executed. The model must reissue them after resumption if needed.
6. The turn runner exits with a suspended status, skips normal final rendering,
   and releases the active route/session claim and provider resources.
7. A suspended turn emits no default or duplicate user response.

Suspension must be represented in turn status and metrics so it is not counted
as an error or ordinary completion.

## Answer Correlation and Authorization

Inbound interception happens after canonical routing is resolved and before
busy-session steering, command handling, or starting a normal turn.

An inbound message can answer a request only when:

- its canonical and route session keys match the stored request;
- channel, account, chat, and topic match where present;
- sender ID matches the trusted sender captured when the request was created;
- the request is still `waiting` and not expired; and
- correlation is unambiguous.

Text channels support two correlation forms:

- a reply to the delivered prompt when reply metadata is available;
- `/answer <short-id> <answer>` for explicit correlation.

When exactly one request is waiting for that authorized route and sender, a
plain next message may be accepted as its answer. In group conversations,
sender matching is mandatory. A message routed to a different canonical session
continues through normal inbound handling. An ambiguous or unauthorized message
for the suspended canonical session is durably deferred for normal continuation
after the interaction closes; it is not appended between the incomplete
assistant tool call and its eventual tool result. It never reveals protected
request details.

The manager validates option labels but always permits bounded free-form text
for clarification questions. Approval interactions accept only the fixed
policy-owned choices `allow_once` and `deny` in the first version.
Supporting channels may project those fixed choices as presentation-only
controls without creating a second answer path. Telegram uses a selective,
one-time reply keyboard on approval prompts and removes it with the final
interaction response. Button presses still enter through the same routed
message authorization and exactly-once answer claim as typed text; `/answer`
remains the explicit fallback. A parent-only task sends a neutral targeted
acknowledgement to remove the controls without exposing its result to the user.

## Atomic Answer Commit and Resumption

Canonical provider history requires every assistant tool call to be followed by
its matching tool result. The existing sanitizer correctly drops incomplete
tool-call turns, so resumption must commit the answer before assembling context.

Answer processing is:

1. Compare-and-swap `waiting -> answer_claimed`, storing inbound message identity
   and the bounded answer.
   At this durable ownership boundary, acknowledge the original inbound spool
   item. Later continuation failures remain registry-owned recovery work and
   must never release the accepted answer for ordinary redelivery.
2. Inspect canonical history for the originating tool call and matching result.
3. If the result is absent, append exactly one `role=tool` message using the
   original tool call ID. Use an error-aware session writer and ingest it into
   the context runtime only after the canonical write outcome is known.
4. Transition `answer_claimed -> resuming`.
5. Claim the session and invoke a dedicated `ResumeInteraction` path with no
   synthetic user or steering message. Context now contains a valid paired tool
   turn and the next LLM call can continue naturally.
6. On normal completion, transition to `resolved`. On a recoverable process or
   provider failure, retain enough state for reconciliation to retry.

Unrelated user input received while an answer is `claimed` or `resuming` keeps
the existing steering/follow-up semantics: it is placed in the deferred-ingress
queue with its spool ID and drained after the interaction becomes terminal.
Explicit `/answer <short-id> ...` traffic remains owned by the interaction
protocol instead. Exact replay of the accepted inbound message is idempotent,
while a losing command is consumed with a bounded already-accepted response and
never enters the steering queue, model context, or conversation history.

The tool-result payload is structured JSON containing request ID, question IDs,
answers, and resolution reason. It must not contain channel envelope data.

History reconciliation makes crash windows idempotent:

- `answer_claimed` plus no tool result: append it and resume;
- `answer_claimed` plus matching result: advance to `resuming` and resume;
- `resuming` plus no active turn: retry resumption;
- a completed continuation plus a nonterminal interaction: detect the matching
  result and later assistant response, then mark resolved;
- conflicting history or mismatched hashes: fail closed and emit diagnostics.

Workspace-local interaction stores are registered in a bounded durable catalog
before an interaction is created. Restart recovery loads cataloged stores in
addition to stores belonging to currently configured agents. If the originating
agent was removed, renamed, or moved to another workspace, recovery terminalizes
the interaction with `agent_unavailable` rather than leaving durable orphaned
state. Empty stores are removed from the catalog only after a healthy load and
successful retention prune. Catalog registration and interaction creation are
serialized against that cleanup so a newly created store cannot lose discovery.
One process-wide interaction coordinator owns that serialization together with
the registry cache, in-memory resolution callbacks, resume-flight deduplication,
and recovery admission. Reloadable delivery components reference this stable
owner instead of copying its mutable state.

## `request_user_input` Tool

The built-in tool is available to normal stateful turns and background tasks,
but not stateless direct turns, ephemeral subturns without durable sessions, or
contexts whose channel cannot deliver a response.

Schema limits:

- one question per tool call; ask later questions after the previous answer resumes the task;
- stable unique question IDs;
- headers up to 64 Unicode code points;
- bounded question and description lengths;
- zero or two to three options per question;
- optional timeout from 60 seconds to 24 hours;
- default timeout supplied by trusted configuration, initially one hour.

The tool itself only validates model input and asks the interaction manager to
suspend. It does not own maps, timers, persistence, inbound routing, or channel
delivery. Tool output on resumption is generated by the manager.

Model-authored calls are deliberately single-question so chat users can answer
naturally without assembling a multi-line `question_id: answer` payload. The
runtime keeps one current persisted interaction contract; incompatible stored
records are handled by a coordinated upgrade rather than permanent readers in
the request path.

All natural-language question presentation is agent-owned. The caller supplies
self-contained question text, headers, option labels, and option descriptions
in the language and style of the conversation. The runtime renders those fields
directly and owns only language-neutral structure: numbering, stable IDs,
option layout, and `/answer` command templates. It does not detect languages,
translate content, or invoke a model after suspension.

On Telegram, option labels are rendered as one-time reply-keyboard buttons.
Every question also offers a `⛔ Cancel turn` button, while the normal message
composer remains available for an arbitrary free-text answer. Replying to the
question passes only the reply text to the interaction parser, excluding the
quoted bot prompt. The keyboard is removed after an answer or cancellation;
`/stop` remains the channel-independent cancellation fallback.

## Human Approval

Approval is a second producer of the same interaction protocol, not a second
waiting subsystem.

The synchronous hook result supports immediate allow or deny decisions. A
trusted approval policy may additionally return `require_human` with a bounded
`action_summary`. The summary is trusted presentation data: the policy must
derive an action-specific, secret-free description from the exact tool request.
It is not model-authored. Runtime renders the exact runtime-owned tool name, the
summary, the short interaction ID, and the literal `allow_once` and `deny`
command choices without additional natural-language prose. It never generically
serializes tool arguments into the human prompt. If a tool later needs richer
presentation, it should expose a dedicated trusted approval descriptor rather
than rely on a universal argument renderer.

The policy hook is part of the presentation security boundary. An empty,
oversized, or control-character-bearing summary fails closed. Runtime remains
responsible for the authorization boundary: route ownership, expiry, the HMAC
binding to canonical arguments, single consumption, and policy revalidation.
The model cannot request approval to elevate its own authority and cannot choose
the approval recipient.

On `allow_once`, the resumed pipeline verifies all of the following before tool
execution:

- interaction ID, tool call ID, tool name, canonical argument hash, and session
  match the pending call;
- the approval is unexpired and has not been consumed;
- current policy still permits human override for that classification.

Expiry is checked atomically both when the answer is claimed and immediately
before the one-time grant is consumed. A grant claimed before its deadline but
resumed or recovered after it expires is denied and never executes.

The approval is consumed exactly once. `deny` appends a normal denied tool result
and resumes the model. Persistent allowlists and approve-for-session behavior are
out of scope until policy and audit evidence justify them.

## Background Task Integration

Add `waiting_for_input` as a nonterminal durable task status and an optional
interaction ID on task records.

- A root or delegated task that suspends transitions from `running` to
  `waiting_for_input`.
- It does not publish completion, consume a completion ID, or start a duplicate
  retry while waiting.
- Answer claim transitions the task back to `running` before continuation.
- Timeout, cancellation, and terminal resume failures propagate through normal
  task state and delivery semantics.
- Task status output identifies that human input is required and includes only
  the safe short request ID and bounded prompt summary.
- Restart reconciliation preserves waiting tasks instead of marking them lost.

## Events, Debugging Evidence, and Privacy

Add typed lifecycle events for created, delivery attempted, waiting, answer
accepted/rejected, resume started, resolved, timed out, cancelled, and failed.
Events include interaction kind, IDs, route/session hashes, task ID, status,
latency, and failure codes. They exclude raw answers, full questions, secrets,
and tool arguments.

Debug capture is optional and non-authoritative. The interaction registry and
canonical session history remain the sources of truth. Capture may correlate
interaction ID, turn ID, tool call ID, task ID, inbound message, and delivery
attempt. Missing evidence is an observable diagnostic gap and never changes the
interaction outcome.

Capture must never block interaction progress, task reuse, pruning, delivery, or
shutdown. It must not add acknowledgement state to the interaction registry.
Lossless projection and cross-store trace transactions are outside this runtime.

This privacy boundary protects the exact accepted-answer payload, its canonical
tool result, and interaction-adjacent diagnostic projections. It is not a
transitive taint system for arbitrary text the model later generates. If the
model deliberately includes answer-derived text in a later ordinary tool call,
that call follows the tool's own argument logging and redaction policy. Approval
continuations consume a normalized allow or deny outcome rather than relying on
free-form approval prose. Implementations may conservatively suppress an
immediate response projection without attaching a durable sensitivity label to
later execution.

The interaction record, accepted answer, and canonical tool result have
exactly-once state transitions. Channel publication cannot be exactly once when
the remote API has no idempotency protocol. For prompts, the stable interaction
delivery key identifies one logical outbox message; the outbox records the
attempt boundary and acknowledges delivery only after remote acceptance.
Recovery never resends an ambiguous prompt and instead resumes the suspended
tool with a `delivery_unknown` outcome. Final-response publication still uses
the interaction-owned delivery state during the first D1 slice; the following
slice moves it to the outbox and deletes that remaining duplicate machinery.
Canceled, expired, completed, or missing interactions durably abandon prompts
that are still known to be unsent, as do interactions whose originating agent
or workspace is no longer available after restart.

Cancellation uses the same durable ordering. `/stop` first transitions the
record to `canceling`, then writes the paired canceled tool result, and finally
terminalizes it. Recovery completes any surviving `canceling` record, so a
crash cannot leave waiting state in conflict with canceled canonical history.

## Configuration

The question tool is enabled by default when durable sessions and outbound
delivery are available. Human approval remains opt-in because it changes tool
execution policy.

Configuration owns operational limits, not interaction authority:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "request_user_input": {
      "enabled": true,
      "default_timeout_seconds": 3600,
      "max_timeout_seconds": 86400,
      "retention_hours": 168
    }
  }
}
```

Invalid bounds fail configuration validation. Disabling the tool prevents new
requests but does not delete existing requests; reconciliation can still resolve,
timeout, or cancel them.

## Recovery and Operations

At startup, after sessions, tasks, channels, and the event sink are available:

1. load and validate nonterminal interactions;
2. claim overdue requests with a timeout outcome;
3. retry only prompts or final responses whose delivery is known to be
   `not_sent`, stop after three attempts, close any suspended tool-call history,
   durably fail the correlated task projection before terminalizing the
   interaction, and reconcile ambiguous delivery without resending;
4. reconcile `answer_claimed` and `resuming` records against canonical history;
5. restore task `waiting_for_input` projections;
6. resume eligible interactions with bounded concurrency;
7. prune terminal records beyond retention and compact the oldest diagnostic
   events before they can consume the bounded snapshot reserve.

Shutdown does not cancel waiting interactions. Explicit task cancellation does.
Deploy/restart tooling must report nonterminal interaction counts and perform a
post-restart reconciliation check.

Session-control commands preserve the suspended tool-call/result pair while
terminating pending work. `/stop` completes durable cancellation and returns
the normal successful stop acknowledgement without resuming the model. A
negative answer such as `no` remains an answer and resumes the continuation.
`/new`, `/reset`, and `/clear` complete durable cancellation before applying
their normal session changes and do not publish a separate stop reply.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A foreground question suspends without a final/default response and resumes
  the exact tool call when its authorized user answers.
- A background task visibly waits, survives restart, resumes once, and delivers
  one completion.
- Duplicate inbound deliveries and concurrent answers produce one tool result
  and one continuation.
- Unauthorized senders cannot answer or inspect a request.
- A restart at every state-machine boundary converges without lost questions,
  duplicate prompts, or duplicate tool execution.
- Timeout and cancellation resume or terminate through explicit audited states.
- Human approval cannot be forged through model arguments or reused.
- Optional debugging evidence never participates in workflow correctness.
- Targeted race tests and broader shared-package tests pass before activation.
