# MintClaw Roadmap

MintClaw is an independent, deployment-focused agent runtime. The roadmap
tracks work that matters for reliable personal automation across supported
platforms.

## 1. Runtime Reliability

- Keep async task delivery deterministic across restarts.
- Continue consolidating tool delivery through the shared delivery coordinator.
- Reduce duplicate final replies after media/file/message tools.
- Keep task-registry records bounded, queryable, and useful for debugging.
- Preserve topic/session routing across Telegram, cron, spawn, and delegate
  paths.

## 2. Context Management

- Keep Seahorse compaction bounded and observable.
- Prefer asynchronous compaction where it is safe.
- Fail closed when context still exceeds provider limits after compaction.
- Keep prompt assembly predictable by reserving budget for tools, non-history
  prompt sections, and required routing context.
- Add focused regression tests for long-session and post-compaction behavior.

## 3. Tooling And Workflow State

- Keep `task_status` as the primary user-facing progress/status command.
- Retire duplicated status surfaces when they no longer add value.
- Improve deterministic test coverage for tool loops, spawned work, and async
  completions.
- Extract a shared path-scope validation package only if non-`exec` tools need
  the same workspace/symlink/allowed-path rules currently enforced by
  `shellguard`.

## 4. Provider And MCP Behavior

- Keep OpenAI OAuth/Codex paths reliable and observable.
- Preserve streamed output and streamed tool-call behavior in provider adapters.
- Keep MCP transport failures explicit and fail-fast.
- Maintain deferred MCP/tool discovery behavior so large tool inventories do not
  pollute ordinary prompts.

## 5. Channels And Media

- Preserve the current `ChannelLifecycle`, `DeliveryRuntime`, and
  `StreamCoordinator` ownership split for startup, retry, reload, inbound
  exposure, readiness, delivery, and streaming.
- Keep shared webhook/HTTP registration tied to active channel runtimes rather
  than configured channel presence.
- Make startup retry generation-aware and cancelable across reload/shutdown.
- Keep gateway readiness aligned with actual channel delivery capability.
- Keep Telegram forum-topic routing stable.
- Preserve media-group handling and forwardable media captions.
- Keep generated images and files deliverable without duplicate completion
  messages.
- Keep channel feedback throttling controlled by real edit intervals.
- Move reply / adjacent-followup / media-only interpretation toward an explicit
  inbound relation model so prompt assembly does not have to guess message
  boundaries from raw history.

## 6. Automation And Agent Workflows

- Keep core workflow primitives deployment-agnostic.
- Support durable queued work without assuming a specific domain or workspace.
- Make spawned/delegated work observable through shared task status surfaces.
- Keep webhook, cron, and manual trigger paths consistent.
- Let deployments layer domain-specific agents and policies outside the core
  runtime.

## 7. Project Coherence

- Keep one canonical MintClaw identity across binaries, modules, packages,
  configuration, release artifacts, and documentation.
- Prefer direct migrations over permanent compatibility aliases.
- Remove superseded behavior once its replacement is validated and deployed.
- Keep platform packaging and runtime conventions explicit and testable.

## 8. Model Selection Architecture

- Keep `/model` as the conversation-scoped model selector and `/switch` as the
  explicit workspace-wide operator path until `/switch` is deprecated.
- Keep model-selection state resolved once per routed turn through
  `effectiveModelBinding`, then pass that immutable execution projection through
  command and runtime code.
- Keep invalid session overrides self-healing and bounded to the routed
  conversation key.
- Preserve current provider/model selection semantics while reducing the amount
  of agent-instance mutation/cloning required to execute a session override.
- Remove remaining derived-agent materialization only in focused call sites
  where the effective binding already owns provider/model resolution; do not
  create a second selection abstraction.
